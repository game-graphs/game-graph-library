# Game Design Toolkit (game-graph-library)

This is the repository accompanying my Master's Thesis in Games Engineering.

The developed tool can be used to model game systems (e.g. worlds, quests, ...) as graphs

---

## Structure

We have split the project into two solutions.
The main library can be found in the ``GDT`` folder
while the examples and tests can be found in ``GDT.Test``


## Examples

To get started have a look at the two largest examples
- Graph: ``YamlStorageTests.cs``
- Pipeline: ``IslandsGenerationTests.cs``
